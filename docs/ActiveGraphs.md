# Active Graph Framework

### **Active Graphs**  
A platform designed for mapping multi-dimensional relationships in data. Active Graphs structure relationships hierarchically across **X** (data entities) and **Y** (interactions) axes, while integrating a **Z** axis to map temporal layers (e.g., Patient ID, scenario context, and timeseries data). This approach creates a seamless method for visualizing and interacting with dynamic, evolving data sets.

### **Active Graph Networks**  
The **boundary layer** of the hypercube, Active Graph Networks act as the connective tissue that emerges from Active Graphs. These networks define relationships, nodes, and edges, enabling the framework to adapt and grow based on real-time inputs. They represent the interplay of structured data and temporal flows within the system.

### **Cube4D**  
Structured data encapsulated within **padded tensors**, forming the foundation of the hypercube. Cube4D evolves in size and complexity as data grows over time or as **Dynamic Relationship Expansion (DRE)** occurs. This dynamic structure allows for seamless scaling and adaptability, transforming static datasets into living, breathing frameworks.

### **ActiveShell**  
A revolutionary **query mechanism** enabling interaction with the system. ActiveShell provides intuitive commands to **get**, **set**, **add**, **create**, or **destroy** data and relationships. It acts as the control interface for manipulating cubes and their relationships.

#### **Core Features of ActiveShell:**
- **Cubes Can Be Stacked**: Cubes are modular, allowing for independent stacking, querying, and manipulation.  
- **Root Cube Queries**: Any query can traverse from a **root cube** to other cubes within the network, unlocking powerful cross-context insights.

This framework redefines data interaction and intelligence by breaking traditional silos, offering the ability to explore, manipulate, and expand multi-dimensional relationships. It's a system designed for adaptability, clarity, and growth.
